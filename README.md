SynSearch
=========

Java application for searching for word synonyms and give suggestions of words with similar lexicographic value. 

Developed to demonstrate the use of binary search trees in terms of organization of information within a balanced 
tree which results in faster retrieval time for the targeted word and the similar ones. The program on startup 
reads a sorted text file of synonyms and builds a balanced BST on which search, insertion, and traversal operations
can be done.

The code is well commented and each function has a description about the algorithm within and what it does.
